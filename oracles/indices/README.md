# Indices

### Overview

Supra Indices serve as a powerful tool for creating fully transparent cryptocurrency indices on the Supra blockchain, similar to traditional equity indices like the S\&P 500 or FTSE 100, using on-chain [price feeds](https://docs.supra.com/oracles/data-feeds/data-feeds-index) from Supraâ€™s low- latency oracle.\
Indices on Supra are permissionless, fully transparent, self-owned, and user-manageable. Anyone can create an index on the Supra L1 network, and leverage it to develop new decentralized applications (dApps) or enhance the functionality of existing ones.

By utilizing any data feed provided by Supra Oracles, users can create their own indices. Additionally, there is an opportunity to collaborate with Supra to have these indices visualised on the Supra Indices [dashboard](https://supra.com/data/indices), further enhancing visibility and usability.\
