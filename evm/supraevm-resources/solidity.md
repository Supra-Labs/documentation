### <mark style="color:red;">What is a Smart Contract?</mark> <a href="#what-is-a-smart-contract" id="what-is-a-smart-contract"></a>

_A program stored on-chain that executes automatically when conditions are met._

A smart contract is a set of instructions deployed to a blockchain. Once live, it runs without intervention from third parties. The code you write defines how it reacts to input, just like any computer program. Because it has its own on-chain address (similar to a wallet), it can hold and manage assets like ETH or ERC-20 tokens, send or receive them, and trigger actions when events happen. This ability to combine data, logic, and asset handling makes smart contracts the foundation of decentralized applications.

In advanced cases, smart contracts can receive off-chain data such as market prices or weather information via oracles, allowing them to connect blockchain logic with real-world data.

### <mark style="color:red;">What is Solidity?</mark> <a href="#what-is-solidity" id="what-is-solidity"></a>

_A high-level programming language for writing smart contracts on EVM-based blockchains._

Solidity is specifically designed for smart contract development. If you’ve worked with JavaScript or C-style languages, the syntax will feel familiar. When you write a contract in Solidity, you define the rules, data structures, and behaviors that will run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or other EVM-compatible chains. You compile that code into bytecode, deploy it to the blockchain, and it executes in a decentralized, deterministic environment.

### <mark style="color:red;">Why Learn Solidity?</mark> <a href="#why-learn-solidity" id="why-learn-solidity"></a>

_Because Solidity opens the door to creating decentralized applications across the EVM ecosystem._

Solidity is the go-to language for writing contracts on major EVM-based chains such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and many others. Learning Solidity gives you access to a large ecosystem of tools, libraries, frameworks, and community support. It enables you to build tokens, DeFi protocols, DAOs, games, and more. If you want to work in blockchain development or deploy smart contracts that can interact with the EVM, Solidity is the best starting point.

### <mark style="color:red;">How Does Solidity Work?</mark> <a href="#how-does-solidity-work" id="how-does-solidity-work"></a>

_Write code, compile it, deploy it, and let the EVM handle execution._

When you write a Solidity contract, you save it as a .sol file and compile it into bytecode that the EVM understands. Once deployed, every node on the network executes the same code to ensure consistent results across the blockchain. The contract lives at a specific address, holds its own state, and can be interacted with by users or other contracts. Because the network is decentralized, you need to consider gas costs, permissions, and security from the start.

### <mark style="color:red;">What Can You Build With Solidity?</mark> <a href="#what-can-you-build-with-solidity" id="what-can-you-build-with-solidity"></a>

**Examples of what’s possible with smart contracts.**

* Tokens and NFTs: Create ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 tokens.
* DeFi protocols: Build staking, liquidity, lending, or yield systems.
* DAOs: Create decentralized organizations with on-chain voting.
* Games and collectibles: Design ownership and trading logic for in-game assets.
* Hybrid applications: Connect your contracts to real-world data through oracles.
