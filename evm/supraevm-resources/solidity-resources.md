# Solidity Resources

Solidity is the most widely used language for writing smart contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains. It provides developers with a familiar, high-level syntax for building decentralized applications that run securely on-chain.

Most Ethereum development tools, such as Hardhat, Foundry, and Remix, are fully compatible with Solidity and can be used to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts across multiple networks.

This page highlights essential resources to help developers learn and build with Solidity, from beginner tutorials and interactive IDEs to advanced guides on gas optimization, testing, and security.

Whether you’re new to smart contracts or looking to refine your development workflow, these resources cover everything from the basics of Solidity syntax to professional practices used in production-grade dApps.

### Frameworks <a href="#frameworks" id="frameworks"></a>
