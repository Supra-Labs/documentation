## Development Tools & Workflows

This section provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and using various development environments to build and deploy smart contracts on Supra's EVM-compatible infrastructure.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>Remix IDE →</strong></mark></td><td>A web-based development environment that allows you to write, compile, deploy, and interact with Solidity smart contracts without needing to install additional dependencies.</td><td><a href="remix-ide/">remix-ide</a></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>Hardhat →</strong></mark></td><td>A powerful development framework for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

## Libraries

JavaScript libraries that allow developers to interact with smart contracts deployed on Supra's EVM. These libraries enable reading blockchain data, sending transactions, and integrating smart contracts into decentralized applications (dApps).

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-target data-type="content-ref"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td><mark style="color:red;"><strong>Web3.js →</strong></mark></td><td>A widely used JavaScript library for interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.
