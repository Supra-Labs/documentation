  This guide walks you through building a Solidity-based DAO Management Contract
  on SupraEVM, including development, deployment, and interaction using Hardhat.

# Hardhat

Hardhat is one of the most popular development frameworks for Solidity, making it easy to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts. On SupraEVM, you can use Hardhat the same way you would on any EVM chain, with just a few small configuration changes.

This guide will show you how to:

* Set up a new Hardhat project for SupraEVM
* Configure the SupraEVM RPC and private key
* Write and compile a Solidity contract
* Deploy to the SupraEVM MultiVM Testnet
* Interact with your deployed contract from scripts

Whether you're experimenting, testing DAO mechanics, or building production-ready applications, Hardhat provides a fast and flexible workflow for building on SupraEVM.
