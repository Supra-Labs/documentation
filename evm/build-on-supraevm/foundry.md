# Foundry

Foundry is a blazing-fast Ethereum development toolkit written in Rust. On SupraEVM, you can use Foundry the same way you would on any EVM-compatible chain, with only a few small configuration changes.

This guide will show you how to:

* Set up a new Foundry project for SupraEVM
* Configure `foundry.toml` with your RPC + private key
* Write and compile a Solidity contract
* Deploy using `forge create` or a Foundry script
* Interact with your deployed contract using `cast`

Whether you're experimenting, building simple demos, or deploying production-grade smart contracts, Foundry gives you a powerful and lightweight workflow for developing on SupraEVM.
