# Learn More SupraEVM

### Flexibility for Developers <a href="#flexibility-for-developers" id="flexibility-for-developers"></a>

* **Zero friction:** Deploy existing contracts with minimal changes
* **Native tooling:** Use familiar development tools and frameworks from each ecosystem
* **Unified infrastructure:** Access the same high-performance Layer 1, Oracle feeds, and automation regardless of which VM you choose
* **Cross-VM interactions:** Smart contracts on different VMs can call each other and share state through Supra’s unified architecture

### Developer Experience <a href="#developer-experience" id="developer-experience"></a>

Supra includes verifiable randomness at the protocol level to provide transparent, tamper-resistant randomness for validator selection and randomized ordering of transaction execution, helping to mitigate vulnerabilities related to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) extraction.

#### MEV Protection <a href="#mev-protection" id="mev-protection"></a>

Native Oracle feeds are integrated directly into the protocol layer, providing continuous, tamper-resistant streams of asset prices, volatility metrics, and external data. This reduces reliance on third-party Oracle networks and minimizes manipulation risks while enabling smart contracts to respond instantly to market conditions.

#### Real-Time Data Integration <a href="#real-time-data-integration" id="real-time-data-integration"></a>

Supra’s Layer 1 blockchain employs the Moonshot consensus algorithm to achieve sub-second consensus finality across distributed validators. This high-performance design ensures that on-chain decisions are finalized rapidly, enabling automation primitives and time-sensitive operations to execute without discretionary delays.

### High-Performance Infrastructure <a href="#high-performance-infrastructure" id="high-performance-infrastructure"></a>

These capabilities are built directly into the protocol layer, eliminating the need for complex and expensive third-party integrations.

* High-speed native Oracle price feeds (covering crypto, equities, commodities, FX)
* On-chain verifiable randomness (dVRF) for tamper-resistant randomness
* Native automation capabilities for deterministic, block-by-block task execution
* Cross-chain messaging through Hypernova and IntraLayer for trustless interoperability

Smart contracts deployed on any supported VM can seamlessly access Supra’s vertically integrated native services, including:

#### Access to Native Services <a href="#access-to-native-services" id="access-to-native-services"></a>

The MultiVM architecture is integrated with Supra’s “Tribe and Clan” node model, which allows different Clans to manage different state shards and use independent VMs. This enables parallel transaction processing across different virtual machines, significantly boosting the network’s overall throughput and efficiency.

#### Parallel Execution <a href="#parallel-execution" id="parallel-execution"></a>

MultiVM fosters a unified ecosystem where assets and information can be exchanged across different VMs on the same L1, avoiding the liquidity fragmentation issues common in appchain-based systems. Smart contracts deployed on any supported VM can interact with each other seamlessly.

#### Interoperability and Shared Liquidity <a href="#interoperability-and-shared-liquidity" id="interoperability-and-shared-liquidity"></a>

Developers can build with their preferred language and environment, streamlining the development process. This removes barriers to entry and allows teams to leverage their existing expertise and codebases.
