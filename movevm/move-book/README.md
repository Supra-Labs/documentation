# Move Book

## Introduction

Welcome to Move, a next generation language for secure asset programming. Its primary use case is in blockchain environments, where Move programs are used to construct state changes. Move allows developers to write programs that flexibly manage and transfer assets, while providing the security and protections against attacks on those assets. However, Move has been developed with use cases in mind outside a blockchain context as well.

Move takes its cue from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by using resource types with move (hence the name) semantics as an explicit representation of digital assets, such as currency.
