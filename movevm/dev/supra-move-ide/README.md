These are the main components of your workspace:

* **Editor**: This is the large area where you write and edit your code.
  * Multi-Tab Support: Open and manage multiple files at once, just like in VS Code.
  * Syntax Highlighting: Provides full color and syntax support for Move, TOML, and Rust files.
  * Auto-Save: All changes to your files are saved automatically.\

* **Console**: The panel at the bottom of the screen shows the output from all actions.
  * Real-time Feedback: See the results from compiling, deploying, and testing as they happen.
  * Read-Only: You cannot type commands directly into the console; it is for viewing output only.
  * Controls: You can Clear the console history or use the arrow icon to toggle its visibility.
