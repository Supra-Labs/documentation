The IDE makes it easy to manage your projects directly in the browser. All project data is stored locally in your browser's IndexedDB.\


* **Create**: Start a new project by clicking Create a new project on the home screen or the + icon in the Explorer. You can create a blank project or start from a pre-built template.\

* **Switch & Read**: Use the dropdown menu in the Explorer to easily switch between your existing projects. Selecting a project will load its file tree.\

* **Update**:
  * Editing: Simply open a file and type in the editor. All changes are saved automatically.
  * Renaming: Right-click on any file or folder in the file explorer to open a context menu where you can select Rename.\

* **Delete**: To delete a project, select it from the project dropdown menu and click the trash can icon. This action is permanent and will delete all associated files.\

* **Import / Export**: Use the Import and Export buttons to load a project from a .zip file or to save your currently selected project as a .zip file for backup or sharing.
