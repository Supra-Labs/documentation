# Create your subscription

To start using dVRF, you need to create a subscription that will manage your random number requests and handle gas payments for callbacks. You can create a subscription in two ways: using the new web interface or through on-chain functions.

{% tab title="Via the web interface" %}
The easiest way to create your dVRF subscription is through subscription manager UI at [supra.com/data/dvrf](https://supra.com/data/dvrf). (Currently EVM networks only.  This feature will go live soon for Supra L1).

#### Prerequisites

* MetaMask or StarKey wallet installed and configured.
* Sufficient funds in your wallet for gas fees.
* Connected to the appropriate network (see [Available Networks](https://docs.supra.com/dvrf/networks))

#### Steps

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   * Navigate to [supra.com/data/dvrf](https://supra.com/data/dvrf)
   * Click "Connect Wallet"
   * Approve the connection request\

2. **Access Subscription Management**
   * Click on "My Subscription" in the interface
   * If you don't have a subscription yet, you'll see an option to create one\

3.  **Create New Subscription**

    * Fill in the required details.
    * Click "Create Subscription"

    **For EVM Chains:**

    * **Max Gas Price**: Maximum gas price you're willing to pay for callback transactions.
    * **Max Gas Limit**: Maximum gas limit allocated for callback transactions.


4. **Review and Confirm**
   * Review your Gas configuration settings.
   * Confirm the transaction in your wallet.
   * Wait for transaction confirmation.\

5. **Verification**
   * Once confirmed, your subscription will be active.
   * You can view your subscription details in the "My Subscription" section.
   * Your wallet address is now registered as the subscription manager.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Via Onchain functions" %}
For developers who prefer programmatic subscription creation, you can interact directly with the smart contracts.\

EVM Chains

```solidity
// Interface for dVRF 3.0 Deposit Contract
interface IDeposit {
    function addClientToWhitelist(
        uint128 maxGasPrice, 
        uint128 maxGasLimit
    ) external payable;
}
```

#### Verification

**Check subscription status**: Use web interface or `getSubscriptionByClient()` function

After creating your subscription, verify it's working correctly.
