| Automation Task               | A transaction registered by a user to be executed automatically when specific conditions are met.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Automation Registry           | The on-chain storage module that tracks all registered tasks, their metadata, and current state.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Epoch                         | A fixed period used for validator synchronization and automation task management. Tasks are activated or removed at epoch boundaries.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Automated Execution           | The process by which validators determine whether and when an automation task should trigger execution based on predefined conditions or scheduled criteria. This occurs at the end of each block.                                                                                                |
| Gas Price Cap                 | The highest unit gas price a user is willing to pay for each execution of the automation task.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Task Max Gas                  | The maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the task during execution. If this limit is exceeded, the transaction fails with execution failure.                                                                                                                                             |
| Automation Fee Cap            | The maximum automation fee a user is willing to pay per epoch. If exceeded, the task is cancelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Pending Task                  | A task that is registered but not yet active. Tasks are pending until the next epoch begins.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Active Task                   | A task that is currently eligible for evaluation and execution in each block.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Task ID                       | A unique identifier assigned to every automation task upon registration. It is used to track, manage, and reference tasks across the registery, API calls, and validator execution.                                                                                                               |
| Cancelled Task                | A task that has been cancelled manually by the user or removed automatically due to fee or balance constraints. Manual cancellations take effect at the start of the next epoch. Fee and balance-based removals are processed immediately at the beginning of each epoch during registry cleanup. |
| Zero-Block Delay              | Execution model in which a task is evaluated and executed within the same block when its condition becomes true.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Congestion Fee                | A dynamically increasing fee applied when task registration surpasses a network-defined congestion threshold.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Automated Transaction Payload | The encoded data submitted via Supra CLI, REST, or SDK during task registration. It contains the target function call, arguments. The logic for execution, such as conditional checks is defined inside the target function itself, rather than as a separate component.                          |
| Payload Transaction           | The packaged Move function call that runs when an automated task is triggered. It includes the function identifier and arguments submitted during task registration, and is executed by the validator if the task conditions are met.                                                             |
