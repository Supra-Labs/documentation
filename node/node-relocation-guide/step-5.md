# Step 5

## Using the same DNS name

If you are utilizing the same DNS name for your new instance:

1. Update the DNS record with the IP address of the new instance.
2. Stop the supra validator node on the old instance.

```
pkill supra
```

Note: You can skip Step 6 and proceed directly to Step 7.
