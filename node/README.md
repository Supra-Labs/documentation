Welcome to the Supra Node Operation Program documentation.

This resource is designed to guide new and experienced participants through the core principles and technical structure of running a node within the Supra ecosystem. As a node operator, you play a crucial role in supporting Supra’s high-performance Layer 1 network and powering its decentralized oracle infrastructure. Your participation helps ensure transaction finality, oracle data reliability, and the security of smart contract operations across an expanding multi-chain environment.

At the heart of Supra’s design is a unique node architecture that combines performance, decentralization, and scalability in a vertical stack. Node operators engage in validating transactions, aggregating data feeds, and contributing to the consensus mechanism—known as Moonshot. Supra’s innovative protocols, paired with its Tribe-Clan hierarchy, ensures that data is processed securely and efficiently. This documentation will walk you through setup, configuration, responsibilities, and rewards.

Welcome aboard—your contributions are vital to shaping the future of decentralized finance and Web3 infrastructure.
