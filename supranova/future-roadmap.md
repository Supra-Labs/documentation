# Future Roadmap

SupraNovaâ€™s architecture is designed to evolve beyond one-way bridging into a fully decentralized cross-chain communication framework.&#x20;

### **Upcoming releases:**

#### Reverse Bridge (Burn-Release)

Users will be able to burn wrapped tokens on Supra (e.g., wETH) to release locked native assets (e.g., ETH) from the source chain. This enables bi-directional bridging.

***

#### PoEL (Proof of Efficient Liquidity) - Service Layer

Future releases may include service modules such as PoEL, enabling:

* Staking across chains
* Ownership validation
* Governance participation

{% hint style="warning" %}
**PoEL will be documented separately and is not part of the current bridge release.**
{% endhint %}

***

#### Multi-Chain Bridging Support

The HyperNova protocol will expand to support additional EVM chains. Each will be integrated based on light client feasibility, validator model, and consensus compatibility.

***

#### HyperLoop Integration for Fast L2 Transfers

For chains where full consensus proofs are unnecessary (e.g., L2 rollups), SupraNova will offer HyperLoop, a fast multisig-based bridging solution with rotating validator sets and game-theoretic safety.
