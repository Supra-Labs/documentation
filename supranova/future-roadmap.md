# Future Roadmap

SupraNovaâ€™s architecture is designed to evolve beyond one-way bridging into a fully decentralized cross-chain communication framework. The following features are planned for upcoming releases:

1. ### Reverse Bridge (Burn-Release)

Users will be able to burn wrapped tokens on Supra (e.g., wETH) to release locked native assets (e.g., ETH) from the source chain. This enables bi-directional bridging.

2. ### PoEL (Proof of Efficient Liquidity) - Service Layer

Future releases may include service modules such as PoEL, enabling:

* Staking across chains
* Ownership validation
* Governance participation

&#x20;**Note:**&#x20;

* **PoEL will be documented separately and is not part of the current bridge release.**

3. ### &#x20;Multi-Chain Bridging Support

The HyperNova protocol will expand to support additional EVM chains. Each will be integrated based on light client feasibility, validator model, and consensus compatibility.

4. ### HyperLoop Integration for Fast L2 Transfers

For chains where full consensus proofs are unnecessary (e.g., L2 rollups), SupraNova will offer HyperLoop, a fast multisig-based bridging solution with rotating validator sets and game-theoretic safety.
